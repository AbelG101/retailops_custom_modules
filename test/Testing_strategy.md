# Custom Modules for Retail Store in Odoo 17

## Scope

The manual testing will cover:
- User interfaces and interactions within the modules.
- Critical user flows to ensure they operate as expected.
- Edge cases and error scenarios to verify the robustness of the modules.

## Approach

Manual tests will be conducted by following a predefined set of steps to run the modules and verify their results. The testing will involve:

### Preparation
- Ensure the development environment is set up correctly.
- Load any necessary test data into the system.

### Execution
- Run each module according to the test case steps.
- Observe and record the outputs generated by the modules.

### Verification
- Compare the observed outputs against expected results.
- Record any discrepancies or errors for further investigation.

### Documentation
- Document the results of each test case, including steps followed, inputs used, outputs observed, and any issues found.

## Resources

### Tools
- Development environment setup (e.g., a Python environment if the modules are written in Python).
- Access to the source code of the modules.
- Any required dependencies and libraries installed.

### Environment
- A test environment that mimics the production setup as closely as possible.
- Access to necessary databases and external APIs.

### Documentation
- Detailed test cases and expected results.
- Tools for recording test results, such as a spreadsheet or a test management tool (e.g., TestRail, Jira).
