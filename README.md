Supermarket management system in the retail industry using Odoo 17, our system offers a seamless integration approach that maximizes efficiency and productivity. With Odoo serving as both the server-side and client-side solution. In addition to Odoo's modules, we have further enhanced our system with custom modules tailored to meet the specific needs of supermarket operations. These include Email Integration for efficient communication, Branch Transfer Management for streamlined logistics, Shelf Space Management for optimal product placement, and Employee Shift Scheduling for effective workforce management.

  1. Inventory management

  4. Customer service
## Vision:
- Our vision is to revolutionize supermarket management by providing a comprehensive and integrated system that enhances efficiency, transparency, and customer satisfaction.
## Goal:
 - The goal of our project is to develop a robust supermarket management system that simplifies daily operations, optimizes inventory control, boosts sales performance, and elevates the overall shopping experience for both customers and staff.
